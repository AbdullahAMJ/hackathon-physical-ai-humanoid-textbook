# The Era of Embodied Intelligence

> "The future of AI isn't just chatbots; it's AI that can see, touch, and move."

## From Digital to Physical
For the past decade, Artificial Intelligence has been trapped behind screens. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Claude 3 have mastered text and code, but they have no body. They cannot wash dishes, fold laundry, or repair a wind turbine.

**Physical AI** changes this. It is the discipline of giving AI a physical form—a robot body—and the intelligence to navigate the messy, chaotic real world.

## The Three Pillars of Physical AI
This course focuses on the three technologies that make this possible:

1.  **ROS 2 (The Nervous System):** The middleware that lets sensors talk to motors.
2.  **NVIDIA Isaac Sim (The Digital Twin):** A physics-accurate simulation where we train robots thousands of times faster than real time.
3.  **VLA Models (The Brain):** Vision-Language-Action models that translate commands like *"Pick up the red apple"* into robotic muscle movements.

## Hardware Requirements
To participate in this course, you need one of the following:

* **Digital Twin Workstation:** NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti (12GB VRAM) or higher.
* **Edge Kit:** NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano (8GB).
